By day I'm a Technician at the UBC Herbarium and the Martone Lab. On the side I help run RLadies Vancouver, the UBC R Study Group and a member of the Richmond Museum Society.

Great conversation starters:

•	Gets excited about plants and algae
•	Even more excited when programming and mapping is involved
•	Pen and paper enthusiast
