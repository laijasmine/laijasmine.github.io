### Keeping myself accountable
I really wanted to really hone my skills in data visualization. But with my schedule it never really happens. So with a blog + [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) schedule...hopefully it will be something more consistent!

#### My goals for this is to:

1. Get my self to consistently blog about my process in R
2. Look into a new facet of R each week
3. Have some material ready to go for the [R study group](https://github.com/UBC-R-Study-group/studyGroup) I run

### some prompts for later:
- [Week 1]() `library(ggtext)`
- [Week 2]() `library(cowplot)`
